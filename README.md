# AWS AppSync Client

This is a typed GraphQL client tailored for AWS AppSync.

It is based on https://github.com/awslabs/aws-mobile-appsync-sdk-js/tree/master/packages/aws-appsync-auth-link

Differences:
- It imports from `@apollo/client/core` so React is _not_ required
- It is the only package in the repository, so it's `npm install`-able directly from GitHub
- Typing is improved
